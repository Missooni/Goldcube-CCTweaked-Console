ff 6It took me years to give CC a chance, and the     
ff 6most popular days of its existance are long gone.

ff 6It's a difficult mod for people to learn and f

ff 6I wanted to make it easier for visually orientedf  
ff 6people to create games using CC. It started as af  
ff 6visual novel API, but is now capable of so much   
ff                                              6more!
ff 6This could not have existed without the APIsf      
ff 6used to bring game functions together. I can't put
ff 6into words how grateful I am for the resourcesf 6and
ff 6tutorials provided by others.0
